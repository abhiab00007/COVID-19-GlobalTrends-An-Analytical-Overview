# COVID-19 GlobalTrends-An Analytical Overview

Dataset chosen: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report

data tables from kaggle are imported to PowerBI and data is thoroughly preprocessed using DAX Expressions to ensure data quality.

Many visualisations are added to both content pages of the project  to convey insights effectively. 

interactive elements like Buttons, Bookmarks and Images are Incorporation to enhance user experience and to complement data analysis. 

Neat Organization of Report is ensured by Clear titling, consistent colors, and thoughtful formatting to improve readability and aesthetics. 

Insightful Analysis derived from the data are:


# Key Metrices:

### 1. Recovery and Fatality Rates:

The 57% recovery rate highlights that over half of the global COVID-19 cases have recovered, showcasing progress in managing the pandemic.

A 3.97% fatality rate underlines the severity of the pandemic and the critical importance of healthcare interventions.



### 2. Testing Efficiency:

A 7.2% Testing Efficiency reflects efforts in scaling up testing globally, though region-specific disparities in testing rates might exist.



### 3. Infection Density:

An infection density of 3.03K per million indicates significant global spread, necessitating targeted containment and prevention strategies in highly dense areas.



### 4. Active vs. Critical Cases:

1% of active cases being critical highlights that most infections are manageable with standard care, while critical cases demand focused medical attention.



### 5. Recovered vs. Deaths:

For every 100 cases, 96 recover, while 4 result in fatalities, showing an encouraging recovery rate but also a need for continued vigilance and healthcare improvement.



# Regional Dynamics and Trends

### 1. Critical Cases Distribution:

The decomposition tree shows the Americas leading with the highest number of critical cases, followed by South-East Asia and Europe, reflecting varying healthcare challenges.



### 2. Active Cases by Continent:

Asia, Europe, and North America have the largest shares of active cases, while Australia reports the lowest, possibly due to effective containment and lower population density.



### 3. Death Trends Over Time:

The death trend chart shows a steady increase from March to July 2020, emphasizing the urgency for mitigation measures during the peak.



### 4. Infection Density Map:

Regions with higher population densities exhibit larger infection densities, necessitating region-specific strategies for resource allocation and infection control.



### 5. Total Cases per Million:

Europe and the Americas display the highest case density, confirming them as global hotspots, while Africa and the Western Pacific show relatively lower densities.



### 6. Recoveries Across WHO Regions:

Recovery patterns highlight strong medical responses in certain regions, with Europe and the Americas leading recovery counts. However, lower recovery rates in some regions suggest gaps in healthcareÂ capacity.
